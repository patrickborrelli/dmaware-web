                                            Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.  They have widely varying tastes, morals and customs in the many different lands where they have settled.  When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries.  They live fully and in the present, making them well suited for the adventuring life - but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br /><br/>

Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world.<br /><br/>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change.<br /><br/>

                                            Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply.  They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy.  They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.  When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring or on a mission, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them.<br /><br/>

The comforts of home are the goals of most halfling's lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.  Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples.  Even those wanderes love peace, food, hearth and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road.  Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edge of wars and political strife.  They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 50 lbs.</td>

Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children.  Many half-elves unable to fit into either society, chose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</td>

                                            To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves they look human.  In height they are on par with both parents, though they are neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans.  They range from 5 feet to about 6 feet and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women.  Half-elf men do grow beards and sometimes grow them to mask their elven ancestry. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.<br /><br/>

The music of the Bard is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.  The Bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.  A Bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer, but a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic sets the Bard apart.  The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility.  Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance.  But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor.</td>

Divine magic is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world.  Clerics are the conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects.  The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.  Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training.  A cleric may learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.  Clerics can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from the heavens to consume their enemies.  For evildoers who would benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into battle with the power of the gods on their side.</td>

Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of trancendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces.  Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals - the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm.  Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.  For Druids, nature exists in a precarious balance.  The four elements that make up the world - air, earth, fire and water - must remain in equilibrium.  If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be broken apart.</td>

Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, weild a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill.

Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.

This energy is an element of the magic that fills the universe - specifically the element that flows through living bodies.  Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents.  Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes.</td>

A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being.  Sometimes the pact between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods.  The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being to access to more powerful spells.  Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks suppliment their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known.  But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish.</td>

Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.  Wizards' lives are seldom mundane.

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lawful Good</span> (LG) characters can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. A Lawful Good character typically acts with compassion, and always with honor and a sense of duty. Lawful Good characters include righteous knights, paladins, and most dwarves. Lawful Good characters, especially paladins, may sometimes find themselves faced with the dilemma of whether to obey law or do what is good, when the two conflict: for example, in upholding a sworn oath when it would lead innocents to come to harm; or where legal injunctions conflict, such as between their religious law and the law of the local ruler.<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Neutral Good</span> (NG) characters do their best to help others according to their needs. A Neutral Good character typically acts altruistically, without regard for or against Lawful precepts such as rules or tradition. A Neutral Good character has no problems with co-operating with lawful officials, but does not feel beholden to them. In the event that doing the right thing requires the bending or breaking of rules, they do not suffer the same inner conflict that a Lawful Good character would.<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Chaotic Good</span> (CG) characters act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. A Chaotic Good character favors change for a greater good, disdains bureaucratic organizations that get in the way of social improvement, and places a high value on personal freedom, not only for oneself, but for others as well. Chaotic Good characters always intend to do the right thing, but their methods are generally disorganized and often out of sync with the rest of society. They may create conflict in a team if they feel they are being pushed around, and often view extensive organization and planning as pointless, preferring to improvise.  Many elves are typically Chaotic Good.<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lawful Neutral</span> (LN) A Lawful Neutral character typically believes strongly in Lawful concepts such as honor, order, rules, and tradition, and often follows a personal code. Examples of Lawful Neutral characters might include a soldier who always follows orders, a judge or enforcer that adheres mercilessly to the word of the law, and a disciplined monk. Characters of this alignment are neutral with regard to good and evil. This does not mean that Lawful Neutral characters are amoral or immoral, or do not have a moral compass, but simply that their moral considerations come a distant second to what their code, tradition, or law dictates. They typically have a strong ethical code, but it is primarily guided by their system of belief, not by a commitment to good or evil<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">True Neutral</span> (N or TN) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and do not take sides. A True Neutral character is neutral on both axes, and tends not to feel strongly towards any alignment. A farmer whose primary overriding concern is to feed his family is of this alignment. Most animals, lacking the capacity for moral judgment, are of this alignment, since they are guided by instinct rather than conscious decision. Many roguish characters who play all sides to suit themselves are also of this alignment (such as a weapons merchant with no qualms selling his wares for profit to both sides in a war). Some Neutral characters, rather than feeling undecided, are committed to a balance between the alignments. They may see good, evil, law, and chaos as simply prejudices and dangerous extremes<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Chaotic Neutral</span> (CN) characters follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. A Chaotic Neutral character is an individualist who follows his or her own heart, and generally shirks rules and traditions. Although Chaotic Neutral characters promote the ideals of freedom, it is their own freedom that comes first; good and evil come second to their need to be free. Chaotic Neutrals are free-spirited and do not enjoy the unnecessary suffering of others. A Chaotic Neutral character does not have to be an aimless wanderer; it may have a specific goal in mind, but its methods of achieving that goal are often disorganized, unorthodox, or entirely unpredictable.<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lawful Evil</span> (LE) characters methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code or tradition, loyalty, or order. A Lawful Evil character sees a well-ordered system as being easier to exploit, and shows a combination of desirable and undesirable traits; while it usually obeys its superiors and keeps its word, it cares nothing for the rights and freedoms of other individuals and is not averse to twisting rules in its favor. Examples of this alignment include undiscriminating mercenary types who have a strict code of conduct, and loyal soldiers who enjoy the act of killing. Like Lawful Good Paladins, Lawful Evil characters may sometimes find themselves faced with the dilemma of whether to obey law or evil when the two conflict. However, their issues with Law versus Evil are more concerned with "Will I get caught?" versus "How does this benefit me?<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Neutral Evil</span> (NE) characters do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.  A Neutral Evil character is typically selfish and has no qualms about turning on its allies-of-the-moment, and usually makes allies primarily to further its own goals. A Neutral Evil has no compunctions about harming others to get what it wants, but neither will it go out of its way to cause carnage or mayhem when it sees no direct benefit for itself. Such a character abides by laws for only as long as it is convenient. A villain of this alignment can be more dangerous than either Lawful or Chaotic Evil characters, since he or she is neither bound by any sort of honor or tradition nor disorganized and pointlessly violent. Examples are an assassin who has little regard for formal laws but does not needlessly kill, a henchman who plots behind his or her superior's back, or a mercenary who switches sides if made a better offer.<br /><br/>

                                            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Chaotic Evil</span> (CE) characters act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. A Chaotic Evil character tends to have no respect for rules, other people's lives, or anything but its own desires, which are typically selfish and cruel. It sets a high value on personal freedom, but does not have any regard for the lives or freedom of other people. Chaotic Evil characters do not work well in groups, as they resent being given orders, and usually behave themselves only out of fear of punishment. It is not compulsory for Chaotic Evil characters to be constantly performing sadistic acts just for the sake of being evil, or constantly disobeying orders just for the sake of causing chaos. They do, however, enjoy the suffering of others, and view honor and self-discipline as weaknesses.<br /><br/>

An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

In the 5th Edition rules, all players have some level of all skills, based on the ability associated with a particular skill. For example, a player who has a Strength score of 14 gets a +2 modifier for Strength. So for any Strength related skills (Athletics), the player will get the same bonus to that particular skill.<br/><br/>Additionally, depending on their character class, players get to choose a proficiency in some number of skills. The character class may also limit the list of skills a character can be proficient in (i.e., a Fighter can choose two skills to be proficient in from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception and Survival). Any skill a player is proficient in has the player's proficiency bonus applied to that skill as well.</div><br/>
