        <strong>Persuasion (Charisma)</strong> - your Persuasion check is based on your Charisma modifier. When you attempt to influence someone, or a group of people, with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Persuasion check. Typically you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating a peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
